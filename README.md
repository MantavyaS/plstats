# ⚽ Premier League Stats App

A live Premier League standings viewer built with **Python**, **Tkinter**, and **API-Football**.

This desktop app pulls real-time standings from the [API-Football](https://www.api-football.com/) REST API and displays them in a clean graphical interface using Python’s built-in GUI library. Designed to be modular, the app will expand to include team pages, player stats, graphs, and more.

## 🚀 Features (Implemented So Far)

- ✅ Pulls live **Premier League standings** (season 2023)
- ✅ Clean GUI built using `tkinter` and `ttk.Treeview`
- ✅ Modular code split into:
  - `main.py` → launcher
  - `api.py` → handles API requests
  - `gui.py` → builds the interface
